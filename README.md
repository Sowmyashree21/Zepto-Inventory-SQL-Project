# Zepto Inventory Analysis

As someone beginning my journey in data analytics, I wanted to apply SQL to a real-world business context. I chose to simulate analysis for Zepto — a fast-paced quick-commerce company — where inventory efficiency and pricing are critical to operations.

This project allowed me to work hands-on with structured data, clean and prepare it, write SQL queries to extract insights, and think critically about business problems.

## Objective

To analyze product-level inventory data using SQL and derive meaningful insights that could help a business like Zepto improve pricing strategy, stock management, and overall product performance.

The focus was on importing data, cleaning it, analyzing it, and interpreting results.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench** – Data cleaning and analysis  
- **Excel** – Initial data exploration and formatting  
- **GitHub** – Project hosting and version control  
- **CSV Dataset** – Contains ~3700 product records  

---

## Dataset Summary

The dataset contains the following fields for each product (SKU):

- Product Name and Category  
- Maximum Retail Price (MRP)  
- Discount Percentage  
- Discounted Selling Price  
- Quantity Available  
- Product Weight in Grams  
- Out-of-Stock Flag  

After importing to MySQL, the data was cleaned for analysis (e.g., removing 0 MRP rows, converting paise to rupees, standardizing types).

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

As part of this project, I identified and calculated several KPIs that would be relevant to inventory and pricing decisions:

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Top Discounts** | Identified top 10 SKUs with the highest discount percentage |
| **Revenue Potential** | Estimated potential revenue by multiplying price with quantity |
| **Stock Health** | Counted SKUs with high MRP that are currently out of stock |
| **Discount Efficiency** | Found expensive products offering very minimal discounts |
| **Category Insights** | Calculated average discount per category |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products |
| **Weight Classification** | Grouped products as Low, Medium, Bulk based on weight |
| **Inventory Load** | Total weight of stock held in each product category |

These metrics not only helped me practice SQL but also understand how businesses track performance.

## What I Learned

This project taught me:

- How to prepare and clean real-world datasets for analysis
- Structuring SQL queries for both operational and strategic questions
- Thinking in terms of KPIs and measurable business value
- Documenting and communicating analytical work professionally

It also gave me a glimpse of what data analysts do daily beyond just coding, like asking the right questions, making assumptions, and focusing on business goals.
